# ARAP_Parameterization_Deformation
- Commited to 2020-2021 Spring/Summer Zhejiang University Advanced Computer Graphics course.
- Please do not cheat. For good of both of us.
- ARAP Deformation and Parameterization.
- Deformation is interactive.
- Xcode project. MacOS executable file. Compiled with -ofast optimization.
- Dependencies: Eigen/igl(No core algorithms about ARAP are used. Only used for user interaction and flip avoid line searching.)/OpenGL/GLFW
- Some code for user interaction (in call_back.h) adapted from https://github.com/alecjacobson/geometry-processing-deformation
- image.h and image.cpp adapted from http://10.76.1.181/courses/training/mitF04/assignments/
- For parameterization '- a'
