# Reduced_ARAP_Deformation
- Committed to 2024-2025 Spring/Summer Yale University CPSC 510.
- Please do not cheat. For good of both of us.
- Deformation is interactive.
- Dependencies: Eigen3, igl(No core algorithms about ARAP are used. igl is only used for user interaction and flip avoid line searching.), system-wide OpenGL, system-wide GLFW3, system-wide OpenCV, generated glad (https://glad.dav1d.de/, select opengl 4.1, core, loader).
- Some code for user interaction (in call_back.h) adapted from https://github.com/alecjacobson/geometry-processing-deformation
- image.h and image.cpp adapted from http://10.76.1.181/courses/training/mitF04/assignments/
- Arguments for deformation are like: '-input ./mesh/bunny_1k.obj -inf_itr'
- A strict disk-like manifold check is not included. Please be sure that the input is disk-like so that results are reasonable for PARAM.
- User interactions when deformation: 
	- mouse left: select anchor points
	- mouse drag: deform interactively
	- press ' ':  enter simulation mode
	- press '1': enter point selection mode
	- press '2': enter region selection mode
